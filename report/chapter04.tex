\chapter{Discussion and Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item Graphical representation of study flow and recruitment at each stage of a clinical trial as well as leakage
\item Figure visualizations (graphical representations of accrual process, waiting time, simulation of accrual in 100 studies)
\item unified derivations and mathematical notation of theoretical models for counts and time
\item Properties of expectation and variance of the distributions for the models of time and counts
\item Extension of code snippet from Carter to model counts but instead of having lambda fixed, it can vary using a poisson-gamma model
\item Extension of carter to exact distributions
\item Not only poisson (aleatory) but poisson-gamma (aleatory and epistemic)
\item Counts: const, Po, PoG
\item Extension of Bagiella's exact distributions
\item Not only Erlang (aleatory) but gamma-gamma (aleatory and epistemic)
\item Time: const, Erlang, GG
\item Exploration of two different approaches to the generation of fluctuating recruitment rates (version 1 and 2)
\item Version 1 different from Version 2
\item Extension of code snippet from Carter to model time but instead of havinng lambda fixed, it can vary using Gamma-gamma model
\item Sensitiviy analysis for models of counts and time
\item Results, I applied theoretical methods to a real example from Carter and compared Carter MC example vs exact
\item MC can be replaced by exact. Faster exact.
\item Limitation 1: only focused on const, Po, PoG, const, Erlang, GG. Future extensions to assume Weibull likelihood are possible
\item Limitation 2: whole study, no consideration of different recruiting centers. Future extensions are possible.
\item Limitation 3: Prior parametrizaton, no elicitation
\item Limitation 4: Do the same for lambda changing over time (version 2)
\item Benefits: Faster, more reliable exact methods that can be used at the design stage of a study to predict accrued counts and the waiting time at each stage indicated by fig 2.
\item Clear extension of Carter's and Bagiella's methods
\item Addressed questions provided by Carter of rate and time based on MC simulations and exact distributions for models on count and time
\end{itemize}
