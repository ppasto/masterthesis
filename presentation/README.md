_Basic instructions_

You need a running installation of (pdf)LaTeX including the package 'beamer'. Typical installations of LaTeX provide the necessary environment.

Extract the zip file locally. You need minimally:

* uzh_logo_e_pos.pdf :     UZH logo
 
* beamerthemebiostat.sty : Style file

* present_noR.tex or present_withR.Rnw : you latex file containing the presentation
    (this file can be renamed, of course)


Depending on your work habits, you can work with RStudio or any other editor. For R studio, we have provided a project file 'present.proj'.


If you include R code via knitr, you may use 'present_withR.Rnw'.

For illustration, we have also included a minimal bibtex file.
