% 
% Closed gaps:
% Graphical representation of study flow and recruitment at each stage of a clinical trial as well as leakage
% Unified derivations and mathematical notation of theoretical models for counts and time
% Properties of expectation and variance of the distributions for the models of time and counts
% Sensitivity analysis for models of counts and time 
% COUNTS
% Extension of carter to exact distributions. 
% We not only have aleatory but also epistemic uncertainty (currently only for counts)
% Not only poisson (aleatory) but poisson-gamma (aleatory and epistemic)
% Graphical representations of accrual process
% The simulation of accrual in 100 studies 
% Exploration of two different approaches to the generation of fluctuating recruitment rates (version 1 and 2)
% Extension of code snippet from Carter to model counts but instead of having lambda fixed, it can vary using a poisson-gamma model
% 
% TIME
% Not only Erlang (aleatory) but gamma-gamma (aleatory and epistemic)
% Graphical representations for waiting time
% Extension of code snippet from Carter to model time but instead of having lambda fixed, it can vary using a Gamma-gamma model 
%  
% Results, I applied theoretical methods to a real example from Carter
% 
% Addressed questions provided by Carter of rate and time based on MC simulations and exact distributions for models on count and time
