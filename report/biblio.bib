% Some sample entries...

% Be consistent with either Journal abbreviations or full descriptions.
% `Number` may be missing for some journal articles.
% Carful with captialization of journal titles, use, e.g., {Bayesian}, {Markov} chain {Monte Carlo}, ...

% There is no unique rule whether to include the address of the publisher for books. Be consistent.\
% example Chu:Geor:99 is the most minimal one.
