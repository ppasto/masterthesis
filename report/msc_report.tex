\noindent
In clinical trials, inaccurate or overly optimistic projections of recruitment rates can lead to significant issues, including the failure to enroll a sufficient number of participants within the required time frame. This can ultimately result in study discontinuation, delays, or inconclusive statistical findings. In practice, many researchers rely on deterministic models that do not adequately capture the uncertainty inherent in the patient recruitment process. While more sophisticated stochastic methods are available, they often use a limited number of simulations, which can yield unstable or inaccurate estimates of trial duration. These limitations highlight the need for more robust and interpretable tools for predicting recruitment timelines.

To address this gap, we developed exact statistical methods that account for both aleatory uncertainty (stemming from random variability) and epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of knowledge). For modeling the number of patients recruited over time, we use a Poisson-Gamma model, while for waiting times between recruitments, we apply a Gamma-Gamma approach. These models enable a more accurate prediction of the time required to achieve a desired sample size. Specifically, our methods estimate the recruitment duration needed to reach the target number of participants with at least 90\% probability. This provides a more reliable basis for planning clinical trials, allocating resources, and setting expectations. By integrating uncertainty more thoroughly, our approach enhances the transparency and credibility of trial planning and supports better-informed decision-making in clinical research.
